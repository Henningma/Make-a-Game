Am not sure how to replay and tellig you thanks for the code.

Am now moved from java to c# - Csharp.  am not sure c# = CSharp if so then am moved to CSharp.
I also made a bridge, radio room, passagde, turbolift, conference room.  But it's only in normal color.

Am not sure what reference to what is normal height for a character/Avatar in game is.
So I need help with that, for now am just playing around about that.
